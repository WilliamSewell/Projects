        <!-- Principle 1 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>1. Structure First, Chaos Later</h2>
                <p>
                    A project with a clear structure saves hours, sometimes days, of confusion later.
                    Define your architecture, data flow, and naming conventions before writing your first line of logic.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 2 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>2. Clarity Beats Cleverness</h2>
                <p>
                    Code golf impresses nobody during maintenance.
                    If future-you can't understand present-you, you've failed as a communicator.
                    Clear, obvious, readable code is a gift to everyone who touches the system.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 3 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>3. UAT Is Sacred</h2>
                <p>
                    A well-set-up UAT environment is the difference between confidence and chaos.
                    It should feel like production, behave like production, and expose issues before users ever see them.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 4 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>4. Say Everything Out Loud</h2>
                <p>
                    Never assume people "just know" what you mean.
                    Stating the obvious prevents misunderstandings, reveals blind spots,
                    and keeps teams aligned with reality rather than assumptions.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 5 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>5. Ask for Help Early</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding is strange. It can take hours of struggle or a single sentence from the right person.
                    Asking for help speeds up learning and avoids building the wrong thing beautifully.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 6 -->
        <div class="experience-box">
            <div class="box-content">
                <h2>6. Own Mistakes Immediately</h2>
                <p>
                    Mistakes are fine. Cover-ups are catastrophic.
                    A lie creates a false reality that everyone operates within, and software built on false assumptions breaks.

                    <li>Use meaningful names; skip meaningless abbreviations.</li>
                    <li>Prefer composition over inheritance when possible.</li>
                    <li>Keep methods short, focused, and single-responsibility.</li>
                    <li>Use async/await properly; don't block threads unnecessarily.</li>
                    <li>Write pure methods when you can; side effects create gremlins.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulate, encapsulate, encapsulate.</li>
                    <li>Dependency Injection isn't optional. It's clarity and testability.</li>

                    <li>Write readable SQL with uppercase keywords and logical formatting.</li>
                    <li>Understand execution plans; they tell the truth.</li>
                    <li>Normalise until you have a reason not to.</li>
                    <li>Never trust user input; parameterise everything.</li>
                    <li>Batch large operations; don't lock tables unnecessarily.</li>
                    <li>Use transactions carefully as they're power tools.</li>

                <p>
                    Code is a conversation with the future.
                    The clearer you speak, the kinder you are to everyone who has to continue the story.
